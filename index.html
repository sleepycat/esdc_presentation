# React@CDS

---

## CDS
>The Government of Canada has an opportunity—and a responsibility—to deliver world-class services to Canadians. <strong>This will require disruption as we make the switch, both technically and culturally, to agile digital delivery models.</strong>
><strong>To accelerate these efforts, I am excited to announce the launch of the Canadian Digital Service (CDS)</strong> to modernize the way the Government of Canada designs and delivers digital services. CDS will be a partner to departments in delivering measurably improved services.
><strong>We are rethinking the service design and delivery process from the user’s perspective</strong>, and engaging users every step of the way.
> <cite>the Honourable Scott Brison</cite>

## React: markup in programming language
```javascript
function Greeting(props) {
  if (props.author) {
    const { firstName, lastName } = props.author
    return <div><h1>{firstName} {lastName}</h1></div>
  } else {
  return <div><h1>Unknown Author</h1></div>
  }
}
module.exports.Greeting = Greeting
```

import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import Header from './Header';
import Footer from './Footer';
import Greeting from './Greeting';

let me = {firstName: "Mike", lastName: "Williamson"}

const App = () => (
  <main>
    <Header/>
      <Greeting author={me} />
    <Footer/>
  </main>
);

ReactDOM.render(
  <App />,

## Components

> Component-based software engineering (CBSE) is
> an approach to software development that relies on software
> reuse. It emerged from the failure of object-oriented
> development to support effective reuse.
> <cite>Kaur, Arvinder, and Kulvinder Singh Mann. "Component based software engineering." International Journal of Computer Applications 2.1 (2010): 105-108.</cite>

## Components

>The main advantages of the Component-Based Development (CBD) approach include effective management of complexity, increased productivity, a greater degree of consistency, and a wider range of usability and extendibility, reduced time to market.

## Composition

### Components let us build with bricks not sand


```javascript
import React from 'react';
import Header from './Header';
import Footer from './Footer';
import Greeting from './Greeting';
import { GoCSignature } from '@cdssnc/gcui'

let me = {firstName: "Mike", lastName: "Williamson"}

const App = () => (
  <main>
    <Header/>
      <GoCSignature width="26em" />
      <Greeting author={me} />
    <Footer/>
  </main>
);

```

### Clear boundaries == speed

* Clean updates
* Clean removal
* Don't need to learn the whole codebase

### Delivering on Reuse: benefiting from each others work
### Work on future projects will benefit past projects
